# Mini Wind Tunnel Project

This repository documents the design and build of a miniature wind tunnel, created to explore and better understand aerodynamic behaviour.  
The project combines hands-on engineering, experimental testing, and self-learning using AI to simulate the approach motorsport teams take in aerodynamic development.

## Project Overview

### Wind Tunnel Design
- Compact, table-top wind tunnel constructed using accessible materials  
- Features a test section for model cars with controlled airflow  
- Incorporated fan-driven airflow with flow straighteners for consistency  

### Testing & Experiments
- Conducted drag and lift assessments on model cars  
- Used smoke/visualisation methods to observe airflow patterns  
- Compared results qualitatively to CFD and real-world aerodynamic principles
